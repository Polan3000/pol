 * Builder for input streams and subclasses whose return value is
 * actually a completable future: this allows for better asynchronous
 * operation.
 *
 * To be more generic, {@link #opt(String, int)} and {@link #must(String, int)}
 * variants provide implementation-agnostic way to customize the builder.
 * Each FS-specific builder implementation can interpret the FS-specific
 * options accordingly, for example:
 *
 * If the option is not related to the file system, the option will be ignored.
 * If the option is must, but not supported by the file system, a
 * {@link IllegalArgumentException} will be thrown.
